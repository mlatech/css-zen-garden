                        <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, <br>incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.<br><br>
                            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved<br> thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser <br>creators.<br><br>
                            The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important <br>lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored <br>techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p<br><br>
                        <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to <br>excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing <br>designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very<br> page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the <br>external CSS file. Yes, really.<br><br>
                            CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. <br>The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by <br>demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of<br> those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have<br> contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p><br><br><br></div>
