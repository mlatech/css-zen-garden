                        <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
                        
                        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,
                            <br>
                            incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and abandoned browsers.
                            <br><br>
                            We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
                            <br>
                             thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser
                             <br>creators.
                             <br><br>
                            The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
                            <br>lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-
                            <br>honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the
                            <br>
                            web.
                        </p<br><br>
                        <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
                        
                        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to
                            <br>
                            excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing
                            <br>
                            designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very
                            <br>
                             page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the
                            <br>
                            external CSS file. Yes, really.
                            <br><br>
                            CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document.
                            <br>
                            The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                            <br>
                            demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of
                            <br>
                            those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
                            <br> contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

                        Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should
                        <br>
                        be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be
                        <br>
                        provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and not the
                        <br>
                        latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
                        <br>
                        real requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
                        <br><br>
                        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
                        <br>
                        implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see
                        <br>
                        fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer
                        <br>
                        number of user agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in
                        <br>
                        mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform.
                        <br>
                        That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at
                        <br>
                        least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by
                        <br>
                        over 90% of the population).
